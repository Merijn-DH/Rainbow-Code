# Coding Challenge #10: Maze Generator with p5.js

Maze generation using [Recursive backtracker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm#Recursive_backtracker) algorithm.

Videos for this challenge:
* Part 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyK_Q5rrcr4
  * In this part, I create the cells which are going to become our maze.
  
* Part 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8UgRyRnvXU
  * In this part, I move through the grid created in Part 1 by evaluating which neighbouring cell will be the next one to be visited.
  
* Part 3: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ju_uxJ9v44
  * In this part, I cover steps 3 and 4 of the recursive backtracker algorithm to generate a maze: Removing walls and marking current cell as visited.
  
* Part 4: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p5IH0L63wo
  * In this final part, I cover the concept of a "stack" and how it's going to help us generate a maze using the Depth-First Search Recursive algorithm
